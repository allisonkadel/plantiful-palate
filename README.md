# TODO
* create migrations
* create models with relationships
* plan out routes for controller following restful conventions and map to CRUD actions
* build controller actions for main model with all CRUD functionality and build corresponding forms
* add user authentication
* add user authorization
* build navigation
* add validations to input fields and error handling
* add index view for ingredients and display names and images
X create a new form to add an ingredient to the db
* add page for users to see all recipes they created
* add page for users to see all ingredients required for their recipes

# Requirements
* Build an MVC Sinatra application.
* Use ActiveRecord with Sinatra.
* Use multiple models.
* Use at least one has_many relationship on a User model and one belongs_to relationship on another model.
* Must have user accounts - users must be able to sign up, sign in, and sign out.
* Validate uniqueness of user login attribute (username or email).
* Once logged in, a user must have the ability to create, read, update and destroy the resource that belongs_to user.
* Ensure that users can edit and delete only their own resources - not resources created by other users.
* Validate user input so bad data cannot be persisted to the database.
* BONUS: Display validation failures to user with error messages. (This is an optional feature, challenge yourself and give it a shot!)

# Future Work - features
* create has_many and belongs_to relationship between users and ingredients so users can CRUD ingredients separately from recipes
* give users the ability to add others' recipes to their cookbook
* give users the ability to add others' ingredients to their pantry
(so their pantries and cookbooks are not limited to only records they've created)

# Refactoring - debugging
* fix line break characters in edit recipe form

# Offline Work
* added customization to pantry and cookbook views
* Enchanced recipe edit form to account for ingredients
